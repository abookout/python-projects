# python-projects
A compilation of the small python projects I've done over time.

## Hi there,
Thanks for checking out my projects. These are some of the small projects I've done that I felt were worth putting up.

My personal favorite and the one I've spent the most time on in here is Word Game (coming up with creative project titles is my passion). 
If you like crossword puzzles, you'll probably like it too.
